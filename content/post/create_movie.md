This guide will show you how to create a simple movie (.avi) from a stack of images using ImageJ.

### Step 1 - Go to the ORNL CG1D Analysis computer

This step is described in detail in our <a href='https://neutronimaging.pages.ornl.gov/en/tutorial/how_to_access_computer/'>
Neutron Imaging Tutorial web page - Connect to our computer</a>.

### Step 2 - Start ImageJ

Navigate to the ImageJ program from the menu

### Step 3 - Load Images

Click ** File > Import  > Image Sequence ... **

<img src='/img/posts/create_movie/step3.png' />

Select **folder** or just **move to folder** and click **Open**

<img src='/img/posts/create_movie/step4_1.png' />
<img src='/img/posts/create_movie/step4_2.png' />

In the dialog box that shows up, select Use Virtual Stack then click **OK**

### Step 4 - Preview Images

Feel free to slide through the images to make sure they are correctly sorted (as they are sorted by alphabeticall order).
If order is wrong, you will need to rename them.

### Step 5 - Make and Save Movie

Click **File > Save As > AVI ... ** to create the AVI file

<img src='/img/posts/create_movie/step7.png' />

Select the **Frame Rate (fps)** in the new dialog box, and click **OK**

<img src='/img/posts/create_movie/step8.png' />

Select *where* you want to create that file and *rename* it if you don't like the default output file name. Click **OK**

<img src='/img/posts/create_movie/step9.png' />

A progress bar will display the status of the file creation.
