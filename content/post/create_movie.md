The best way to reference work done by others is by using their DOI (Digital Object Identifier). This is easy for
paper publication but not as easy for software, until now. Thanks to [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).

Here are the steps to create a DOI for your python library

## Step 1 - Create an account on [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

<img src='/img/posts/create_doi/screen1.png' />

## Step 2 - Link your application

In this example, I'm using my github account. By doing so, I am able to automatically see all my github repository by
clicking the **GitHub** button in the menu, on the left side of the zenodo web page.

Then you can just turn On or Off the button next to your repository to make the connection

## Step 3 - Create release of GitHub project

Go back to your GitHub project and create a **release**.

<img src='/img/posts/create_doi/screen4.png' />
<img src='/img/posts/create_doi/screen5.png' />
<img src='/img/posts/create_doi/screen6.png' />

## Step 4 - Check

If you go back to the **zenodo** web site, you should see the new DOI created for the release you juste made.
