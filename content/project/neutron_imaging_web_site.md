Using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">HUGO</a> framework, I implemented the <a href="https://neutronimaging.pages.ornl.gov">
Oak Ridge National Laboratory Neutron Imaging Web Site</a>.

## Why?

Being granted beam time at our beam lines can be intimidating as they are many steps that have to be completed before
coming to the facility. We used to try to answer those questions by email. This present some issues:
 * easy to miss some steps
 * previous users coming to the beamline hesitate in contacting us again
 * information we send can easily be out of date

So we decided to use centralize those information into a web site hosted by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

## How?

To implement this web site, I used the following tools:

* <a href="https://gohugo.io/">HUGO</a> framework to built the web site.
* <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-theme-learn/en">Hugo learn theme</a>.
* <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> for the implementation of the web site.
