      <description>I had some issue in one of my project when running my unit test from the command line and from my IDE. I could never have both happy at the same time. This was related to the way I was calling local file used in my unit tests.
Using the command line, I had to refer to the file using relative path, but the IDE was looking for full path (which is obviously wrong).</description>
