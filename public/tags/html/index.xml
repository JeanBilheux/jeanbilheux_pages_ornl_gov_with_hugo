      <description>Using HUGO framework, I implemented the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Neutron Imaging Web Site.
Why? Being granted beam time at our beam lines can be intimidating as they are many steps that have to be completed before coming to the facility. We used to try to answer those questions by email. This present some issues: * easy to miss some steps * previous users coming to the beamline hesitate in contacting us again * information we send can easily be out of date</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you here how you can easily create an HTML document from a notebook.
1 - First thing you need is make sure your notebook has a title
# this is my title  Then, make sure that all the other headings of the notebooks have a lower hierarchy.
2 - Then you will need to import the following python libraries
&amp;gt; pip install sphinx &amp;gt; pip install nbconvert &amp;gt; pip install pandoc &amp;gt; pip install latex &amp;gt; pip install nbsphinx  Somehow, I had to use conda for the pandoc library to work.</description>
