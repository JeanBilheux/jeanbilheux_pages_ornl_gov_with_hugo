      <description>Introduction When working with neutorn imaging files, one of the first thing we need to do is removing the gamma spots. Those spots are pixel that recorded gammas strikes, not neutrons strikes.
To do so, we are going to use the convolve library from scipy.
Initialize Fake Data Set import numpy as np from scipy.ndimage import convolve # let&#39;s create a 10x10 random array of values between 0 and 1 my_array = np.</description>

      <description>Using HUGO framework, I implemented the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Neutron Imaging Web Site.
Why? Being granted beam time at our beam lines can be intimidating as they are many steps that have to be completed before coming to the facility. We used to try to answer those questions by email. This present some issues: * easy to miss some steps * previous users coming to the beamline hesitate in contacting us again * information we send can easily be out of date</description>
